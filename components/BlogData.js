    title: "6 Ways to Prevent Constant Hunger When Losing Weight",
    author: "Lauren Krouse",
    date: "March 18 2020",
    content: `Hunger is one of the main reasons people have trouble losing weight and maintaining weight loss. When you eat less, your body slows your metabolism (making it harder to shed pounds) and also makes you feel hungrier (by tweaking levels of ghrelin and leptin, hormones that regulate feelings of hunger and fullness). While some level of hunger is natural and normal when you’re trying to lose weight, if sticking with your calorie goal has been a challenge, there are a few ways you can lessen the burden.
    \bStock up on calorie-free drinks you enjoy like fruit-infused water, sparkling water or tea — and keep them within reach with a water bottle or thermos. In addition, if three square meals regularly set you up for late-night munchies, one way to quiet hunger bells is to eat high-volume, high-fiber foods throughout the day by including things like tomatoes, radish, celery etc. If you’re used to chowing down until you’re uncomfortably full, eating slower makes for a great strategy to dial down your hunger signals and avoid overeating. “It takes time for your stomach to feel that you are full and send a signal to your brain that then sends a signal back to your stomach to slow down the emptying and make you feel fuller.`,

    title: "Is Dill a Super Herb?",
    author: "Lisa Fields",
    date: "March 17, 2020",
    content: `Dill, an herb that pairs nicely with seafood, chicken, potatoes and soups, may add more to your meal than its distinct flavor. “Both the seeds and leaves of the dill plant have been found to be rich in several plant compounds with antioxidant properties, including flavonoids, terpenoids and tannins,” says Carol Aguirre, RD. Other research shows dill could have an anti-diabetic effect and may also have a positive impact on high cholesterol levels. “Dill is rich in vitamins A and C, which help eye health and boost the immune system, respectively,” says Aguirre. “It’s also a good source of calcium for healthy bones [and] riboflavin for cell function and development.” Even though you might not eat a ton of dill at a time, “you will still get nutrients from sprinkling it over your food, in smaller doses,” she adds. Researchers in South Africa used computer simulations to examine the anti-diabetic effects of specific biochemical compounds found in a number of herbs and spices, including dill, based on the proteins targeted by current drugs for Type 2 diabetes patients. 
Their study showed dill was one of the herbs that contained several biochemical compounds that bind to the protein targets, which helps lower blood-sugar and cholesterol levels in people with Type 2 diabetes. “Dill is a flavorful herb that can add a nutritional boost to your diet, but more research is needed to confirm the best therapeutic outcome,” says Aguirre. In other words, don’t expect it to be a magic cure-all for diabetes or cholesterol, but if you enjoy its flavor, consider adding it to dishes like baked salmon, latke waffles and pasta.`,

    title: "On a Diet? Here’s When You’ll Start Noticing Weight Loss",

    If you’re trying to lose weight, consistency is key, even when you feel like progress is slow. While just a week of eating in a caloric deficit (i.e., eating fewer calories than you burn) can feel like an eternity, it usually requires more time than that to notice the effects of your hard work. Sure, we know there’s rarely instant gratification associated with a healthier lifestyle and weight loss, but how long should you expect it to take to notice you’re shedding the pounds? To answer that question, let us dig a little deeper than the number you see on the scale.
“There’s no surefire way to know if you’re losing fat or water weight, but if you drop a substantial amount of weight in a few days, chances are good that it is mostly water weight,” says Lewis. That said losing water weight isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Losing excess water weight initially can actually be helpful and very motivating when you’re first starting. Day-to-day weight increases and decreases can also make it tricky to track how much weight you’re losing. “When you see fluctuation, recognize it is mostly due to things other than fat gain or loss,” says Lewis. “Many people only see a couple of pounds of fluctuation, but you may see 5 pounds or more depending on your overall weight and gender.”
In terms of how your body looks, “it usually takes 4 weeks for your friends to notice weight loss, and 6–8 weeks for you to notice,” says Ramsey Bergeron, a certified personal trainer.

A lot of the reasons you may fill unmotivated to work out is because of negativity. You can combat those negative thoughts with some good help. Instead of looking at exercising as a negative, look at as a positive by rewarding yourself after you’ve accomplished your goal. It will help keep your motivation to workout. If setting a goal and seeing those being accomplished is not motivating enough, maybe the following tips may motivate you to keep going:
•	Change your way of thinking: Think of your workout as a reward to find a routine you enjoy that makes it a treat to participate in
•	Listen or Watch: listen to a new album or your favorite podcast or watch your favorite show or vlog while working out; this can be a reward for simply showing up
•	Money Jar: when you work out, put a dollar or so in the jar. When you get to $100, or whatever your goal is, use the money for a treat like a new outfit or a day outing
•	Relax: reward yourself with downtime after your workout instead of thinking of all the things you need to do
•	Document: document your work out to see the rewards of working out
•	Treat reward: you may have that candy bar as a reward occasionally
•	Massage: Get a massage after your workout. Not only will it provide you with relaxation, but it will help your muscles to recover
Hopefully, you will be able to get yourself motivated to keep up the workouts. The majority of individuals know how important exercise is for the heart. In fact, The Heart Foundation has an article called, “The Top 10 Excuses For Not Exercising (and Solutions). It provides helpful tips for combating those excuses. Remember, if you just get bored with the same routine and dread going, then maybe it is time to change that routine. Keeping your routine fresh, and rewarding yourself occasionally, is the key to staying motivated.
